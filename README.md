# PastureSeed
Inspired by the item of the same name in the Botania mod.

Craft the seed by surrounding one bone meal with seeds. Right click the pasture seed on a dirt block and watch the surrounding dirt blocks change to grass. Which blocks are transformed is random. Coarse dirt and podzol will not be changed.
