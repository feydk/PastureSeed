# PastureSeed
Inspired by the item of the same name in the Botania mod.

## What it does
Right clicking the pasture seed on a dirt block will turn patches of surrounding dirt into grass blocks. It works in a horizontal radius of 3 and vertical radius of 1, selecting random blocks within that range to transform.

Coarse dirt and podzol (subtypes of dirt) will not be changed.

## Crafting
Craft the pasture seed by surrounding a piece of bone meal with regular seeds (wheat seeds) in a 3x3 crafting grid.
